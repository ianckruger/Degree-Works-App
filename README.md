# pookie-bears-degrees

This is a Fullstack project developed by Team Pookie Bears, consisting of Ian Kruger, Victor Nguyen, Brandon Nguyen, and Bradley Zenker for the University of South Carolina's CSCE 247 Software Engineering Class. 

Using a stack of Java, JSON and JSON.Simple, and JavaFX, we created an app that can create and load student data based on their degree process for the University of South Carolina. This app also allows for faculty, like advisors, to register and view a selected student's progress. 

Included in the repository are 4 main folders.
  - bin: pdfs of all SCRUM and prep work done outside of coding
  - json / lib: all jar files and json data written or loaded by the program.
  - src/tests: executable unit tests for the system.
  - src/frontend-app: all frontend and backend executables required to run the Java App

Attached to this repository is also a git projects containing a SCRUM board of issues and commits for work done throughout the semester.
